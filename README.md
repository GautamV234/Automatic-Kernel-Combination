# Automatic Kernel Combination for Non-parametric Regression Models

This repository provides a powerful library for automatic kernel combination in non-parametric regression models, focusing specifically on Gaussian Processes. The library offers efficient implementations of both semi-grid and full-grid searching algorithms, allowing you to explore and optimize kernel combinations effortlessly.

In addition to the traditional approaches, we have also incorporated Neural Kernel Networks inspired by the paper ["Differentiable Compositional Kernel Learning for Gaussian Processes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04326) into our library. These Neural Kernel Networks leverage the capabilities of PyTorch, providing a flexible and scalable solution for learning compositional kernels within the Gaussian Process framework.

## Features

- Semi-grid and full-grid searching algorithms for automatic kernel combination.
- Implementation of Neural Kernel Networks for Gaussian Processes using PyTorch.
